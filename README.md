# Multinational-Retail_Data_Centralisation
## This project extracts data from multiple sources and adds them all in a central database. Then, the database schema is created and queries are run to extract useful information related to the central database.

## To use this script and extract some of the data from AWS, you would need a csv file with the access key and secret access key.
